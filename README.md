## Spring Boot Data with MongoDB Database

### Spring Data:
Spring Dataâ€™s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.
It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects that are specific to a given database. The projects are developed by working together with many of the companies and developers that are behind these exciting technologies.

### MongoDB Database:
MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License.
- Rich JSON Documents:
    - The most natural and productive way to work with data.
    - Supports arrays and nested objects as values.
    - Allows for flexible and dynamic schemas.
- Powerful query language:
    - Rich and expressive query language that allows you to filter and sort by any field, no matter how nested it may be within a document.
    - Support for aggregations and other modern use-cases such as geo-based search, graph search, and text search.
    - Queries are themselves JSON, and thus easily composable. No more concatenating strings to dynamically generate SQL queries.
- All the power of a relational database, and more...
    - Distributed multi-document ACID transactions with snapshot isolation.
    - Support for joins in queries.
    - Two types of relationships instead of one: reference and embedded.

### NoSQL database terms:
- Database:     
It is a container for collections and can be thought as similar to an RDBMS database, which is a container for Tables.
- Collection:   
It is equivalent to Tables in RDBMS, but unlike a collection it has a dynamic schema. A collection exists within a database.
- Document:     
It is a single record in a MongoDB collection. It can be thought of as a row in RDBMS.
- Field:    
A document has zero or more fields. It's like an RDBMS column having a key-value pair.

### MongoDB 4.0 transactions with Spring Data:
With MongoDB 4.0, ACID transactions have arrived in the Document store, enforcing all-or-nothing execution and maintaining data integrity. In Version 4.2, Multi-Document transactions supports transaction on replica sets, sharded clusters .
- When the transaction has committed all data operations on the transaction will commit automatically.
- If any operation fails, the transaction will fail.
- When the transaction has failed all data operations on the transaction will roll back automatically.
- Until transaction committed no write operation data will be exposed to the outside world.

### Application.Properties:
As long as you use Mongo 2.x, you can specify a host/port as above.
If you use the Mongo 3.0 Java driver, spring.data.mongodb.host and spring.data.mongodb.port are not supported. In such cases, spring.data.mongodb.uri should be used to provide all of the configuration.

### Project Descriptions :
please see application.properties files in resources folder and select a active profile "dev" or "com" to run project. you can check test methods too.  

By default, mongodb has no enabled access control.
- Download and install mongodb from "https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community"
- Go to Control Panel > System & Security > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > navigate to the Path variable hit Edit and add "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin" to the end of Path
- open cmd and run:
    - mongo --port 27017
- Create the user administrator:
    - use admin
    - db.createUser(
        {
          user: "motaharinia",
          pwd: passwordPrompt(), // or cleartext password
          roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, "readWriteAnyDatabase" ]
        }
      )
    - enter password: 123456
    - db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )
    - restart mogodb service in windows
- check your databases list:
    - mongo --port 27017  --authenticationDatabase "admin" -u "motaharinia" -p
    - show dbs
- create database (To display database, you need to insert at least one document into it):
    - use testdb
    - db.user.insert({"username":"eng.motahari@gmail.com"})
    - show dbs

### IntellliJ IDEA Configurations :
- IntelijIDEA: Help -> Edit Custom Vm Options -> add these two line:
    - -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
    - -Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8
- IntelijIDEA: File -> Settings -> Editor -> File Encodings-> Project Encoding: form "System default" to UTF-8. May be it affected somehow.
- IntelijIDEA: File -> Settings -> Editor -> General -> Code Completion -> check "show the documentation popup in 500 ms"
- IntelijIDEA: File -> Settings -> Editor -> General -> Auto Import -> check "Optimize imports on the fly (for current project)"
- IntelijIDEA: File -> Settings -> Editor -> Color Scheme -> Color Scheme Font -> Scheme: Default -> uncheck "Show only monospaced fonts" and set font to "Tahoma"
- IntelijIDEA: Run -> Edit Configuration -> Spring Boot -> XXXApplication -> Environment -> VM Options: -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
